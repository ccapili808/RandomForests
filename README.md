# RandomForests

This implementation was done in Java by Chai Capili and Vasileios Grigorios Kourakos


### How to run
    Please use RandomForest.jar 
    The program takes in four inputs at runtime:
    1. The type of impurity measure to use (gini, entropy, Misclassification Error)
    2. The alpha value for Chi Square termination 
    3. The number of trees to use in the forest
    4. The number of features to use in each tree

    Please give the program some time to compile and the following output will be displayed: 

    Output: 
    1) The validation accuracy, average depth per tree in the forest, average forest accuracy
    2) The resulting classifications for mushrooms

### More notes on this Implementation
    Our code is modular, and allows us to see how alpha, splitting type, the number of trees, and the number of 
    features affect the accuracy of the forest. Please see the report above for our findings.
